# Understanding Linear Regression Algorithm with Practical Example
This repository delves into the mechanics of the Linear Regression algorithm, demystifying the mathematical concepts behind it. By providing a hands-on example, we demonstrate how to train a Linear Regression model from scratch without relying on libraries like scikit-learn. This approach ensures a deeper understanding of the algorithm's workings, empowering you to leverage its full potential in your projects.
